# to attack. After printing this,
# we need to show the player their opponent's board (without the ship)
# in order for them to see where they've attacked before,
# so this while loop should use drawBoardWithoutShip()
# and pass it the opponent's board.
# Then, this while loop should call chooseAttack and save it in a variable,
# just like we do with raw input. For example:
# answer = raw_input()
# if the result of chooseAttack equals "won", then
# we should print that this player won and break out of the while loop.
# if the result of chooseAttack does NOT equal "won",
# we should change player_n_turn to make it the other player's turn.
# This means making player_n_turn = 1 if it is currently equal to 2,
# or else making it equal to 2 if it is currently equal to 1.
